    "A large p-value (here 0.45) for country US indicates that there is not enough evidence to reject the null-hypothesis. We cannot reject the null-hypothesis. Hence, there is no evidence for a difference between the new and old pages. This is confirmed by the z-value being not bigger than 1,96 or smaller than -1.96.\n",
    "The result is similar for country Canada, however, here the p-value is way smaller.\n",
    "In total it is shown that the country of the user does not impact the conversion rate between the new and old page."
